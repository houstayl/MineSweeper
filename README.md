# MineSweeper
This is a Python program that generates minesweeper puzzles. It can then solve these puzzles by generating and solving Boolean algebraic expressions. This program was developed using the principles of object-oriented programming.
To run the program, run MinesweeperRunner.py. You will also have to install pygame and sympy, which can be done using pip.
To play the game (Note: you need an actual mouse with a scroll wheel in order to activate the solving process. This may be a problem if you are using a laptop without an actual mouse):
  Left-click the mouse button to reveal a square.
  Right-click the mouse button to place a flag.
  Click down on the center scroll wheel to activate the solving mechanism. You must first left-click to reveal some squares before activating the solving mechanism.

Note: If the puzzle is unsolvable, the program will run indefinitely. This means it is up to the user to stop the execution of the program in this case.
Note: The console will print out information regarding the boolean expression being solved.
